We assume the files are put or to be put in their default directories. The
locations may be different if the settings are changed.

This directory contains two subdirectories, "DOUBLE" and "SINGLE". The name
"DOUBLE" means with double-precision floating-point arithmetic, and likewise
the name "SINGLE" means with single-precision floating-point arithmetic.

Go to "./DOUBLE/" and "make", and you should get the four MEX object files:
------
./DOUBLE/symtrieig.o     (for eigenvalues of a symmetric tridiagonal matrix)
./DOUBLE/laneig.o        (for the standard Lanczos algorithm)
./DOUBLE/polyfilt.o      (for polynomial approximation for filtering)
./DOUBLE/filtlan.o       (for the filtered Lanczos algorithm)
------
The combination of the four files forms the archive file
"../LIB/libdfiltlan_mex.a", where the character 'd' means double precision.

If any problem occurs, try to adjust the settings in these files:
------
../Make.inc              (for general settings)
./DOUBLE/Makefile        (for the files *.o *.a listed above)
------
In particular, in "../Make.inc" you can choose to compile by the OCTAVE
compiler mkoctfile (with "MEX_FLAG =") or by the MATLAB compiler mex (with
"MEX_FLAG = USE_MATLAB"). Be sure that you have OCTAVE or MATLAB installed
in your machine. To skip the MEX compilation, use "MEX_FLAG = NO_MEX".

With "../LIB/libdfiltlan_mex.a" ready, go to "../DRIVERS_MEX/" where there
is "../DRIVERS_MEX/Makefile", and "make" generates the two MEX drivers with
double-precision floating-point arithmetic:
------
../DRIVERS_MEX/laneig.$(MEXEXT)
../DRIVERS_MEX/filtlan.$(MEXEXT)
------
Here $(MEXEXT) is the MEX file name extension defined in "../Make.inc". See
"../DRIVERS_MEX/README" for information about the two MEX drivers.

Replacing "DOUBLE" by "SINGLE" in the above procedure, one can obtain the
object files with single-precision floating-point arithmetic in "./SINGLE/",
and an archive file "../LIB/libsfiltlan_mex.a" from combining these object
files, where the character 's' stands for single precision.  However, there
is no MEX driver provided for the single-precision computation, since at
this point both OCTAVE (version 3.2.4) and MATLAB (versions 2010b and 2011a)
do not have an implementation of sparse matrices of single-precision
floating-point numbers.

 What are the files to make and how to make them?
============================================================================

We assume the files are put or to be put in their default directories. The
locations may be different if the settings are changed.

This directory contains two source files to generate two MEX files for
OCTAVE/MATLAB users. The two source files are:
------
./filtlan_mex.cpp   (filtered Lanczos algorithm for eigenvalue computations)
./laneig_mex.cpp    (standard Lanczos algorithm for eigenvalue computations)
------
The two MEX files to generate are filtlan.$(MEXEXT) and laneig.$(MEXEXT),
where $(MEXEXT) is the MEX file name extension defined in "../Make.inc". It
can be "mex" or "mexa64", depending on your system.

To make the two MEX files, the following two archive files are required:
------
../LIB/libdfiltlan_mex.a
../LIB/libdmatkit_mex.a
------
Here the character 'd' stands for double precision.

If the first archive file is missing, go to "../OBJ_MEX/DOUBLE/" and "make".
If the second archive file is missing, go to "../MATKIT/OBJ_MEX/DOUBLE/" and
"make". More information can be found in "../OBJ_MEX/README" and
"../MATKIT/OBJ_MEX/README".

"make" should generate the two MEX files. If any problem occurs, try to
adjust the settings in the following files:
------
../Make.inc                              (for general settings)
../MATKIT/OBJ_MEX/DOUBLE/Makefile        (for "../LIB/libdmatkit_mex.a")
../OBJ_MEX/DOUBLE/Makefile               (for "../LIB/libdfiltlan_mex.a")
./Makefile                               (for the two MEX files)
------
In particular, in "../Make.inc" you can choose to compile by the OCTAVE
compiler mkoctfile (with "MEX_FLAG =") or by the MATLAB compiler mex (with
"MEX_FLAG = USE_MATLAB"). Be sure that you have OCTAVE or MATLAB installed
in your machine. To skip the MEX compilation, use "MEX_FLAG = NO_MEX".

Both MEX files are in double-precision floating-point arithmetic. There is no
MEX file provided for the single-precision computation, since at this point
both OCTAVE (version 3.2.4) and MATLAB (versions 2010b and 2011a) do not
have an implementation of sparse matrices of single-precision floating-
point numbers.

Alternatively, you may also compile the mex files with "make_octave_mex.m"
for OCTAVE or "make_matlab_mex.m" for MATLAB. The former file is useful to
make the mex files for OCTAVE in Windows, the version not via Cygwin.


============================================================================
 "laneig" computes eigenvalues by a standard Lanczos procedure
============================================================================

A manual page can be obtained by executing "laneig" without input arguments
in OCTAVE/MATLAB console. A brief description is as follows.

The usage of laneig:
------
[V, D, info] = laneig(A, nev, part, opts);
[V, D]       = laneig(A, nev, part, opts);
    D        = laneig(A, nev, part, opts);
------

input:
1. A is a sparse matrix whose eigenvalues are to be sought.
2. nev is the number of eigenvalues requested (default 6).
3. part indicates which part of eigenvalues are sought:
   "SA" - Smallest Algebraic, for the smallest eigenvalues
   "LA" - Largest Algebraic, for the largest eigenvalues (default)
   "BE" - Both Ends, one more from high end if nev is odd
4. opts is a collection of Lanczos options default options will be used if
   opts is not specified.

output:
1. V is a dense matrix whose columns are the computed eigenvectors of A.
2. D is a vector or a sparse diagonal matrix formed by the computed
   eigenvalues of A.
3. info gives some information about the computation.


============================================================================
 "filtlan" computes eigenvalues by a filtered Lanczos procedure
============================================================================

A manual page can be obtained by executing "filtlan" without input arguments
in OCTAVE/MATLAB console. A brief description is as follows.

The usage of filtlan:
------
[V, D, info] = filtlan(A, [a,b], opts);
[V, D]       = filtlan(A, [a,b], opts);
    D        = filtlan(A, [a,b], opts);
[V, D, info] = filtlan(A, [a,b], polydeg, opts);
[V, D]       = filtlan(A, [a,b], polydeg, opts);
    D        = filtlan(A, [a,b], polydeg, opts);
[V, D, info] = filtlan(A, [a,b], polydeg, basedeg, opts);
[V, D]       = filtlan(A, [a,b], polydeg, basedeg, opts);
    D        = filtlan(A, [a,b], polydeg, basedeg, opts);
------

input:
1. A is a sparse matrix whose eigenvalues are to be sought.
2. [a,b] is the interval in which the eigenvalues are requested.
   If a==-inf, the requested eigenvalues are the smallest ones.
   If b== inf, the requested eigenvalues are the largest ones.
   If [a,b] is properly inside the spectrum, the requested eigenvalues are
   interior.
3. polydeg is the polynomial degree (default 10, which should be increased
   if the requested eigenvalues are interior especially in a narrow interval
   relative to to the range of spectrum).
4. basedeg is the base filter degree (default 10). Degrees from 5 to 15 are
   usually good.
5. opts is a collection of filtered Lanczos options; default options will be
   used if opts is not specified.

output:
1. V is a dense matrix whose columns are the computed eigenvectors of A.
2. D is a vector or a sparse diagonal matrix formed by the computed
   eigenvalues of A.
3. info gives some information about the computation.

 An m-file for a batch test
============================================================================

Finally, the m-file "test_mex.m" gives a batch test using the matrix
"../DATA/laplacian221.mat". The sample OCTAVE and MATLAB diary files are
also provided as "octave_diary.log" and "matlab_diary.log", respectively.

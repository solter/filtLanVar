"test_laplacian221.sh" is a shell script for a batch test in double
precision computation. Use "sh test_laplacian221.sh" to run the test.
------
1. The drivers invoked are in the directory "../DRIVERS/DOUBLE/".
2. The matrix whose eigenvalues are sought is "../DATA/laplacian221.mtx".
3. The output files are in the directory "./LOG/".
------

"test_laplacian221_single.sh" is a shell script for a batch test in single
precision computation. Use "sh test_laplacian221_single.sh" to run the test.
------
1. The drivers invoked are in the directory "../DRIVERS/SINGLE/".
2. The matrix whose eigenvalues are sought is "../DATA/laplacian221.mtx".
3. The output files are in the directory "./LOG_SINGLE/".

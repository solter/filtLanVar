This directory is for containing the MATKIT documentation files using
doxygen. Go to "../INCLUDE/" and run "doxygen matkit_doxygen.cfg" and you
should obtain two directories "./html/" and "./latex/". See the generated
documentation files therein. Please make sure that your machine has doxygen
installed.

The MATKIT header files *.h are in "../INCLUDE/", and they are all
documented in doxygen style. If the directory is changed, specify it with   
the tag "INPUT" in "../INCLUDE/matkit_doxygen.cfg".

A MATKIT tag file "matkit_doxygen.tag" is also generated. It is specified
with the tag "GENERATE_TAGFILE" in "../INCLUDE/matkit_doxygen.cfg". This tag
file "../INCLUDE/matkit_doxygen.tag" can be used for other project
documentations to link to the MATKIT documentation.

We assume the files are put or to be put in their default directories. The
locations may be different if the settings are changed.

This directory contains two subdirectories, "DOUBLE" and "SINGLE". The name
"DOUBLE" means with double-precision floating-point arithmetic, and likewise
the name "SINGLE" means with single-precision floating-point arithmetic.

Go to "./DOUBLE/" and "make", and you should get the six object files:
------
./DOUBLE/matkitfunc.o            (for routines without classes)
./DOUBLE/basics.o                (for class Basics)
./DOUBLE/vector.o                (for class Vector)
./DOUBLE/matrix.o                (for class Matrix)
./DOUBLE/symmatrix.o             (for class SymmetricMatrix)
./DOUBLE/spmatrix.o              (for class SparseMatrix)
------
The combination of the six object files forms the archive file
"../../LIB/libdmatkit_mex.a", where the character 'd' means double precision.

If any problem occurs, try to adjust the settings in these files:
------
../../Make.inc                   (for general settings)
./DOUBLE/Makefile                (for the files *.o *.a listed above)
------
In particular, in "../../Make.inc" you can choose to compile by the OCTAVE
compiler mkoctfile (with "MEX_FLAG =") or by the MATLAB compiler mex (with
"MEX_FLAG = USE_MATLAB"). Be sure that you have OCTAVE or MATLAB installed
in your machine. To skip the MEX compilation, use "MEX_FLAG = NO_MEX".

Replacing "DOUBLE" by "SINGLE" in the above procedure, one can obtain the
files with single-precision floating-point arithmetic. The object files are
in "./SINGLE/", forming the archive file "../../LIB/libsmatkit_mex.a", in
which the character 's' stands for single precision.

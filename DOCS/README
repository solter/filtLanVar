This directory is for containing the FILTLAN documentation files using
doxygen. Goto "../INCLUDE/" and run "doxygen filtlan_doxygen.cfg" and you
should obtain two directories "./html/" and "./latex/". See the generated
documentation files therein. Please make sure that your machine has doxygen
installed.

The FILTLAN header files *.h are in "../INCLUDE/", and they are all
documented in doxygen style. If the directory is changed, specify it with
the tag "INPUT" in "../INCLUDE/filtlan_doxygen.cfg".

FILTLAN uses MATKIT for matrix computations. The FILTLAN documentation also
links to the MATKIT documentation with the tag "TAGFILES".

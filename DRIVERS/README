 What are the drivers to make and how to make them?
============================================================================

We assume the files are put or to be put in their default directories. The
locations may be different if the settings are changed.

This directory contains the following C++ files:
------
./laneig_driver.cpp               (for eigenvalue computations by filtlan)
./filtlan_driver.cpp              (for eigenvalue computations by laneig)
./numeig_driver.cpp               (for estimating the number of eigenvalues)
./polyfilt_driver.cpp             (for plotting data of a polynomial filter)
------
They are source files used to generate the drivers with the same names
without the extension ".cpp".

To make the drivers in double-precision floating-point arithmetic, go to 
"./DOUBLE/" and "make", and the drivers are generated in "./DOUBLE/". The
following two archive files are required:
------
../LIB/libdmatkit.a
../LIB/libdfiltlan.a
------
Here the character 'd' stands for double precision.

If the first archive file is missing, go to "../OBJ/DOUBLE/" and "make".
If the second archive file is missing, go to "../MATKIT/OBJ/DOUBLE/" and
"make". More information can be found in "../OBJ/README" and
"../MATKIT/OBJ/README".

If any problem occurs, try to adjust the following files:
------
../Make.inc                       (for general settings)
../MATKIT/OBJ/DOUBLE/Makefile     (for "../LIB/libdmatkit.a")
../OBJ/DOUBLE/Makefile            (for "../LIB/libdfiltlan.a")
./DOUBLE/Makefile                 (for the four drivers)
------

If "make" in "./DOUBLE/" is successful, the four drivers are generated:
------
./DOUBLE/laneig_driver            (for eigenvalue computations by filtlan)
./DOUBLE/filtlan_driver           (for eigenvalue computations by laneig)
./DOUBLE/numeig_driver            (for estimating the number of eigenvalues)
./DOUBLE/polyfilt_driver          (for plotting data of a polynomial filter)
------

Replacing "DOUBLE" by "SINGLE" in the above procedure, the corresponding
drivers in single-precision floating-point arithmetic are generated in
"./SINGLE/".

 More about the drivers
============================================================================

Executing each driver, e.g. "filtlan_driver", without input arguments gives
a manual page.

The driver "laneig_driver" computes extreme eigenvalues of a (sparse)
symmetric matrix by a standard Lanczos procedure without restarting.

The driver "filtlan_driver" computes extreme or interior eigenvalues of a
(sparse) symmetric matrix by a polynomial filtered Lanczos procedure.

The driver "numeig_driver" estimates the number of eigenvalues in a given
interval. A (tight) window which covers all eigenvalues is required to
determine the filter. If the window is not provided, the Lanczos algorithm
will be used to compute one.

The driver "polyfilt_driver" can be used to preview a polynomial filter, for
example, with GNUPLOT. This is the only driver not requiring LAPACK, since
it does not need to compute eigenvalues of a symmetric tridiagonal matrix.

Finally, there are two shell scripts for batch tests in "../TEST/". See

"../TESTS/README" therein.

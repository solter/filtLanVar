============================================================================
 A brief description
============================================================================

This directory contains the source files for the two drivers for extreme
eigenvalues of a symmetric matrix:
------
arpack_driver    (ARPACK implementation of implicitly restarted Lanczos)
silaneig_driver  (shift-and-invert Lanczos w/ partial reorthogonalization)
------
Both drivers work just with double-precision floating point arithmetic. The
code can be adapted for single-precision floating point arithmetic.


============================================================================
 The ARPACK driver
============================================================================

The source files contained in this directory for "arpack_driver" are
"arpack.h", "arpack.cpp", and "arpack_driver.cpp".

To make "arpack_driver", you also need the MATKIT and ARPACK archive files:
1. It is assumed that the MATKIT archive file is "../LIB/libdfiltlan.a",
   which can be obtained by going to "../OBJ/DOUBLE/" and "make". If any
   problem occurs, see "../OBJ/README" for more information.
2. With your ARPACK archive ready, set "ARPACK_LIB" in "./Make.inc".

The LAPACK package is also required. Check "../Make.inc" to see whether it
is properly set.

With all ready, "make arpack_driver" will obtain the executable file
"arpack_driver", and run "./arpack_driver" without parameters for a manual
page of this driver.


============================================================================
 The shift-and-invert Lanczos driver
============================================================================

The source files contained in this directory for "silaneig_driver" are
"silaneig.h", "silaneig.cpp", and "silaneig_driver.cpp".

To make "silaneig_driver", you also need
1. The MATKIT archive file "../LIB/libdfiltlan.a", which can be obtained in
   the way described above.
2. You also need UMFPACK for sparse LU. The UMFPACK requires the AMD and
   UFconfig libraries. It is recommended to also have the CHOLMOD, CAMD,
   CCOLAMD, COLAMD, and metis-4.0 libraries. Set the parameters in the
   UMFPACK section in "./Make.inc"

The LAPACK package is also required. Check "../Make.inc" to see whether it
is properly set.

With all ready, "make silaneig_driver" will obtain the executable file
"silaneig_driver", and run "./silaneig_driver" without parameters for a
manual page of this driver.

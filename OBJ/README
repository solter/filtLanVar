We assume the files are put or to be put in their default directories. The
locations may be different if the settings are changed.

This directory contains two subdirectories, "DOUBLE" and "SINGLE". The name
"DOUBLE" means with double-precision floating point arithmetic, and likewise
the name "SINGLE" means with single-precision floating point arithmetic.

Go to "./DOUBLE/" and "make", and you should get the four object files:
------
./DOUBLE/symtrieig.o     (for eigenvalues of a symmetric tridiagonal matrix)
./DOUBLE/laneig.o        (for the standard Lanczos algorithm)
./DOUBLE/polyfilt.o      (for polynomial approximation for filtering)
./DOUBLE/filtlan.o       (for the filtered Lanczos algorithm)
------
The combination of the four object files forms the archive file
"../LIB/libdfiltlan.a", where the character 'd' means double precision.

If any problem occurs, try to adjust the settings in these files:
------
../Make.inc              (for general settings)
./DOUBLE/Makefile        (for the *.o *.a files listed above)
------

With "../LIB/libdfiltlan.a" ready, go to "../DRIVERS/DOUBLE/" where there is
"../DRIVERS/DOUBLE/Makefile", and "make" generates the four drivers with
double-precision floating-point arithmetic:
------
../DRIVERS/DOUBLE/laneig_driver   (for eigenvalue computations by filtlan)
../DRIVERS/DOUBLE/filtlan_driver  (for eigenvalue computations by laneig)
../DRIVERS/DOUBLE/polyfilt_driver (for estimating the number of eigenvalues)
../DRIVERS/DOUBLE/numeig_driver   (for plotting data of a polynomial filter)
------
See "../DRIVERS/README" for more information.

Replacing "DOUBLE" by "SINGLE" in the above procedure, one can obtain the
files with single-precision floating-point arithmetic. The object files are
in "./SINGLE/", the archive file is "../LIB/libsfiltlan.a", and there are
four corresponding drivers in "../DRIVERS/SINGLE/".

Two shell scripts for batch tests are provided in "../TESTS/". See
"../TESTS/README" for more information.
